Fighting Hell-Rat Behemoths on OSRS can be a big hassle when you have to monitor your cat's health, especially when fights take several minutes to complete.
Accidentally letting your cat die can mean a 6-hour tax to grow one back up to a Wily Cat. To avoid accidentally losing cats, this plugin was created to help monitor and alert users to heal their cats when they reach <60% and <30% health.
